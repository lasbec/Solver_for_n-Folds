# Solver_for_n-Folds

"V1" contais the plain implementation of the algorithm introduced in the paper 
"Faster Algorithms for Integer Programs with Block Structure" from Friedrich Eisenbrand and Christoph Hunkenschr√∂der and Kim-Manuel Klein published in 2018.

"V2" contais the same implementaiton withadds some "zero-column-checking" improvement

"Results" contains results for some benchmark test runs and the test instances too.

"Instance_generating" contains code to generate test instances of n-folds.
